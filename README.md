A backend developer-friendly, minimum installation of Laravel, with nearly no packages.
Does not have a database connection, a cache connection, a queue, or any frontend.
Has QoL PHP packages.

## Why

The current starter kits of Laravel require you to understand and use an incredible amount of packages.
This means setting up a simple stack you might have in mind requires you to clean up everything from some starter kit or the default installation before installing some other stack.
Instead, I've made this, which can be thought of as a "additive" starting point for Laravel, rather than one that is "subtractive", requiring you to remove packages you don't need.
